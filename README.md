Organize multiple compendiums of dnd5e classes, subclasses, and spells into one window where your players can see what is available to them.

When installed a 'wand' button is viewable in the left-hand side. This opens the main pages. A settings menu in the header lets a GM configure the sources that the classes, subclasses, and spells are pulled from, as well as configure the general look of the application, and the different spell lists per class.

The pages are automatically populated with every class, subclass, and spells from your compendiums that you add to the 'Sources' configuration menu. One page will be created for each class, with tabs for the class, the subclasses, and any spells you have marked as belonging to this class via the 'Spell Lists' menu.
