Organize multiple compendiums of dnd5e classes, subclasses, and spells into one window where your players can see what is available to them.

When installed a 'wand' button is viewable in the left-hand side. This opens the main pages. From here, the GM can change what sources are pulled from via the 'Sources' setting in the header, and change the look of the pages via the 'Art Settings' button. The 'Spell Lists' button opens a menu where the GM can toggle what spells belong to what class.

The pages are automatically populated with every class, subclass, and spells from your compendiums that you add to the 'Sources' configuration menu. One page will be created for each class, with tabs for the class, the subclasses, and any spells you have marked as belonging to this class via the 'Spell Lists' menu.
